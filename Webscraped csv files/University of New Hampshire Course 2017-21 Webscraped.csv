Animal Sciences (ANSC),ANSC #444A,- Animal Ethics: Your Child or Your Pet,"
Human attitudes toward other animals are generally divided into five categories: animal exploitation, animal use, animal welfare, animal rights, and animal liberation. While all five categories are examined, this course concentrates on the differences between animal welfare and animal rights. These two categories differ fundamentally on the basis of the ethical or moral status they give animals. Past human societies have justified both the worship of animals and the torture and sacrifice of animals to the gods. Animal rights believers rely on a rights-based philosophy, while animal welfare advocates concentrate on a utilitarian based set of values. Course concentrates on the application of these two ethical philosophies to current uses of animals such as the use of animals in research, the use of animals as food (factory farming), the production and use of transgenic animals, and the use of animals as organ donors for humans (xenotransplantation). Since animal rights is, in itself, not a discipline, students depend on information from other disciplines ranging from moral philosophy and ethics to history to genetics, production agriculture, and ethology.

Fungi represent a diversity of both form and function and occupy nearly every habitat and niche on the planet. The fungi have been crucial in early and current scientific discovery as many species are used as model systems in biological sciences for the study of ecology, epidemiology, evolution, genetics, genomics, and physiology. Fungi occupy a number of important niches in natural and man 
made environments including: human, animal, insect, and plant pathogens, plant symbionts, organic matter decomposers, food source, antibiotic production, and are a crucial component of global nutrient cycling. The most recent use of fungi has been the identification of specific enzymes produced by fungi to degrade lignin substrates for the production of biofuels.

Zoology (ZOOL),ZOOL #444,- Dogs to Dragons: Origins of Species,"
 A freshman ""inquiry"" seminar introducing fundamental evolutionary concepts and mechanisms, as well as examining the nature of science, and the ways in which scientists use imagination and inference to better understand the natural world. Through evolutionary case studies ranging from the very real to the purely imaginary, students learn to compare and assess explanatory hypotheses, and to use creative, scientifically-disciplined inference as working scientists do. They also develop their abilities to decide what is or isn't science, and to judge the relevance and adequacy of evidence claimed to support hypotheses. The course begins by introducing the mechanism of natural selection through the engaging example of dog domestication, move from there to broader discussions of speciation (including species definitions, and case studies of speciation in progress). The central portion of the course focuses on issues of definitions (what is a ""hypothesis"" anyway?), and developing increasingly sophisticated and well-informed judgments about different sorts of biological information. In the final section, we explore proper and improper roles of imagination and creativity in science: how (and why) real scientists use fictional species, and how to tell the difference between fictions and frauds while leaving room for humor and invention.

Animal Sciences (ANSC),ANSC #444A,- Animal Ethics: Your Child or Your Pet,"
Human attitudes toward other animals are generally divided into five categories: animal exploitation, animal use, animal welfare, animal rights, and animal liberation. While all five categories are examined, this course concentrates on the differences between animal welfare and animal rights. These two categories differ fundamentally on the basis of the ethical or moral status they give animals. Past human societies have justified both the worship of animals and the torture and sacrifice of animals to the gods. Animal rights believers rely on a rights-based philosophy, while animal welfare advocates concentrate on a utilitarian based set of values. Course concentrates on the application of these two ethical philosophies to current uses of animals such as the use of animals in research, the use of animals as food (factory farming), the production and use of transgenic animals, and the use of animals as organ donors for humans (xenotransplantation). Since animal rights is, in itself, not a discipline, students depend on information from other disciplines ranging from moral philosophy and ethics to history to genetics, production agriculture, and ethology.

Zoology (ZOOL),ZOOL #444,- Dogs to Dragons: Origins of Species,"
 A freshman ""inquiry"" seminar introducing fundamental evolutionary concepts and mechanisms, as well as examining the nature of science, and the ways in which scientists use imagination and inference to better understand the natural world. Through evolutionary case studies ranging from the very real to the purely imaginary, students learn to compare and assess explanatory hypotheses, and to use creative, scientifically-disciplined inference as working scientists do. They also develop their abilities to decide what is or isn't science, and to judge the relevance and adequacy of evidence claimed to support hypotheses. The course begins by introducing the mechanism of natural selection through the engaging example of dog domestication, move from there to broader discussions of speciation (including species definitions, and case studies of speciation in progress). The central portion of the course focuses on issues of definitions (what is a ""hypothesis"" anyway?), and developing increasingly sophisticated and well-informed judgments about different sorts of biological information. In the final section, we explore proper and improper roles of imagination and creativity in science: how (and why) real scientists use fictional species, and how to tell the difference between fictions and frauds while leaving room for humor and invention.

While all five categories are examined, this course concentrates on the differences between animal welfare and animal rights. These two categories differ fundamentally on the basis of the ethical or moral status they give animals. Past human societies have justified both the worship of animals and the torture and sacrifice of animals to the gods. Animal rights believers rely on a rights-based philosophy, while animal welfare advocates concentrate on a utilitarian based set of values. Course concentrates on the application of these two ethical philosophies to current uses of animals such as the use of animals in research, the use of animals as food (factory farming), the production and use of transgenic animals, and the use of animals as organ donors for humans (xenotransplantation).
